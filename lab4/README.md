# JavaScript Lab 4

## Overview

This lab includes an HTML file (`index.html`) and three JavaScript files (`constructorFunctions.js`, `class.js`, and `oloo.js`). The objective is to demonstrate different ways of creating and initializing a `Person` object, along with implementing various methods related to sleep, eat, and buy.

## Instructions

### 1. Constructor Functions (`constructorFunctions.js`)

- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
- The script defines a `Person` constructor function with methods `sleep`, `eat`, and `buy`.
- A `person1` object is created using the constructor, and the initial state is logged to the console.
- Uncomment the method calls (`sleep`, `eat`, `buy`) to observe changes in the `person1` object's state.

### 2. Classes (`class.js`)

- Uncomment the second script tag (`<script src="class.js"></script>`).
- Open the updated `index.html` file in your web browser.
- The script defines a `Person` class with constructor and methods (`sleep`, `eat`, `buy`).
- A `person1` object is created using the class, and the initial state is logged to the console.
- Uncomment the method calls (`sleep`, `eat`, `buy`) to observe changes in the `person1` object's state.

### 3. OLOO (Objects Linking to Other Objects) (`oloo.js`)

- Uncomment the third script tag (`<script src="oloo.js"></script>`).
- Open the updated `index.html` file in your web browser.
- The script uses OLOO pattern to create a `Person` object with methods (`init`, `sleep`, `eat`, `buy`).
- A `person1` object is created using the OLOO pattern, and the initial state is logged to the console.
- Uncomment the method calls (`sleep`, `eat`, `buy`) to observe changes in the `person1` object's state.
