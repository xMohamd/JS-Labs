# JavaScript Lab 6

## Overview

This lab focuses on exploring object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in JavaScript. The lab consists of three parts, each showcasing different aspects of OOP, including class creation, inheritance, and static methods.

## Instructions

### Part 1: Shape Class

Create a `Shape` class with properties for name, sides, and side length. Implement a method, `calcPerimeter`, to calculate the perimeter of the shape.

### Part 2: Square Class

Create a `Square` class that extends the `Shape` class. Add a method, `calcArea`, to calculate the area of the square.

### Part 3: Triple and SquaredTriple Classes

Create a `Triple` class with a static method to triple any number. Extend it with the `SquaredTriple` class, which overrides the `calculate` method to square the triple of a given number. Explore the use of static properties and methods.
