# JavaScript Lab 7

## Lab Overview

This lab consists of two parts, each focusing on creating a different web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Part 1: Login Page
Create a simple login page where users can input their username and password. When the user clicks the login button, a JavaScript object (`login`) is created to hold the user's data. If the entered username is "admin" and the password is "123", a "Welcome" message is displayed. Otherwise, a "Not Registered" message is shown. This part emphasizes DOM manipulation to retrieve user input and display messages.

## Part 2: Todo List App
Build a Todo list application where users can add tasks by entering the task name and clicking an "Add" button. New tasks are dynamically added to the tasks list. Users can mark a task as done by clicking a green checkmark button, updating the task status to "done." Additionally, users can delete a task by clicking a delete button. This part focuses on the dynamic addition and removal of tasks using JavaScript.

### Instructions

1. **Part 1: Login Page**
   - Open `login.html` in a web browser to access the login page.
   - Enter a username and password, then click the login button.
   - If the entered username is "admin" and the password is "123," the page will display a "Welcome" message.
   - Upon successful login, you will be automatically redirected to Part 2 (Todo List App).
   - If the login is unsuccessful, a "Not Registered" message will be displayed.

2. **Part 2: Todo List App**
   - Open `todoList.html` in a web browser to access the Todo list application.
   - Enter a task name in the input field and click the "Add" button to add a new task to the list.
   - Click the green checkmark button next to a task to mark it as done.
   - Click the red "X" button next to a task to delete it from the list.
