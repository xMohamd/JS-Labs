# JavaScript Lab 5

## Overview

This JavaScript lab focuses on implementing a system for managing employees in a company using classes and modules. It involves creating classes for `Person`, `Employee`, and `Office`, and a menu system to interact with these classes.

## Instructions/Files

### 1. `personClass.js`

Create a `Person` class with methods for managing a person's sleep, health rate, and available money after buying items.
