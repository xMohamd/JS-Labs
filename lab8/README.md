# JavaScript Lab 7

## Lab Overview

This lab consists of two parts, each focusing on creating a different web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Part 1: Image Slider

Create an Image Slider similar to the provided design. When the user clicks the "Next" button, the next image should replace the current image, and the current image should become the previous image. Optionally, you can use `setInterval` to animate the images and give a slide effect.

### Part 2: Digital Watch with Alarm

Implement a digital watch with an alarm option. The digital watch displays the current time in hours, minutes, seconds, and AM/PM format. Users can set an alarm by specifying the desired hours, minutes, and seconds. When the alarm time matches the current time, the user is alerted using a dialog box.
