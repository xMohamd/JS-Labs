# JavaScript Lab 2

## Overview

This lab comprises an HTML file (`index.html`) and three JavaScript files (`script1.js`, `script2.js`, and `script3.js`). The primary objective is to collect user age, count vowels in a string, and convert 24-hour time to a 12-hour format.

## Instructions

### 1. User Age (Script 1)

- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
- The page will prompt you to enter your age (positive numbers only).
- If you cancel or enter an invalid input, appropriate alerts will guide you.
- Based on your age, you will receive a classification message (Child, Teenager, Grown up, or Old).

### 2. Counting Vowels in a String (Script 2)

- Uncomment the second script tag (`<script src="script2.js"></script>`).
- Open the updated `index.html` file in your web browser.
- Enter a string when prompted.
- The page will display the number of vowels (a, e, o, u, i) in the provided string.

### 3. 12-Hour Clock Conversion (Script 3)

- Uncomment the third script tag (`<script src="script3.js"></script>`).
- Open the updated `index.html` file in your web browser.
- Enter the hour (0-23) when prompted.
- The page will convert the 24-hour time to a 12-hour clock format and display the result.
