# JavaScript Lab 3 [Part 1]

## Overview

This lab includes an HTML file (`index.html`) and two JavaScript files (`script1.js` and `script2.js`). The primary focus is on implementing a basic login system and a calculator with additional bonus functionalities.

## Instructions

### 1. Login System (Script 1)

- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
- You will be prompted to enter a username and password.
- If the provided credentials match ("admin" and "421$$"), a success message will be displayed.
- Incorrect username, incorrect password, and incorrect username/password combinations will result in corresponding error messages.

### 2. Calculator and Bonus Operations (Script 2)

- Uncomment the second script tag (`<script src="script2.js"></script>`).
- Open the updated `index.html` file in your web browser.
- Enter the first number, choose an operation (sum, subtract, multi, division, moduls), and enter the second number.
- The calculator will display the result, and you will be prompted to continue with additional operations (bonus).
- To continue with bonus operations, enter "yes" when prompted, and perform additional operations with the result.
- Enter "no" to stop the bonus operations.
