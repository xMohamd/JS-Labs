# JavaScript Lab 3 [Part 3]

## Overview

This lab consists of an HTML file (`index.html`) and three JavaScript files (`objectMethods.js`, `arrayMethods.js`, `closure.js`). The goal is to explore and explain various object methods, array methods, and closures in JavaScript.

## Instructions

### 1. Object Methods (`objectMethods.js`)

- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
- The script uses 10 predefined object methods, such as `Object.assign()`, `Object.create()`, `Object.defineProperty()`, etc.
- Each method is explained with a code example to demonstrate its usage and purpose.

### 2. Array Methods (`arrayMethods.js`)

- Uncomment the second script tag (`<script src="arrayMethods.js"></script>`).
- Open the updated `index.html` file in your web browser.
- The script uses 10 predefined array methods, such as `Array.concat()`, `Array.copyWithin()`, `Array.indexOf()`, etc.
- Each method is explained with a code example to demonstrate its usage and purpose.

### 3. Closures (`closure.js`)

- Uncomment the third script tag (`<script src="closure.js"></script>`).
- Open the updated `index.html` file in your web browser.
- The script defines a nested function to explain the concept of closures and lexical environment.

### Bonus

- A bonus script (`bonus.js`) is provided, implementing the `countApplesAndOranges` function. This function calculates how many apples and oranges will fall on Sam's house.

## Report

The `report.md` file contains a markdown report showcasing and explaining three selected array methods (`Array.find()`, `Array.forEach()`, `Array.map()`). Each method is accompanied by a code example to illustrate its functionality.
